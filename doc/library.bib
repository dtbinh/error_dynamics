@article{Prentice2010,
abstract = {When a mobile agent does not known its position perfectly, incorporating the predicted uncertainty of future posi- tion estimates into the planning process can lead to substantially better motion performance. However, planning in the space of probabilistic position estimates, or belief space, can incur substantial computational cost. In this paper, we show that planning in belief space can be done efficiently for linearGaussian systems by using a factored form of the covariance matrix. This factored form allows several prediction and measurement steps to be combined into a single linear transfer function, leading to very efficient posterior belief prediction during planning.We give a belief-space variant of the Probabilistic Roadmap algorithm called the Belief Roadmap (BRM) and show that the BRM can compute plans substantially faster than conventional belief space planning. We conclude with performance results for an agent using ultra-wide bandwidth (UWB) radio beacons to localize and show that we can efficiently generate plans that avoid failures due to loss of accurate position estimation},

abstract = {The mobile robot localization problem is treated as a two-stage$\backslash$niterative estimation process. The attitude is estimated first and is$\backslash$nthen available for position estimation. The indirect (error state) form$\backslash$nof the Kalman filter is developed for attitude estimation when applying$\backslash$ngyro modeling. The main benefit of this choice is that combined dynamic$\backslash$nmodeling of the mobile robot and its interaction with the environment is$\backslash$navoided. The filter optimally combines the attitude rate information$\backslash$nfrom the gyro and the absolute orientation measurements. The proposed$\backslash$nimplementation is independent of the structure of the vehicle or the$\backslash$nmorphology of the ground. The method can easily be transferred to$\backslash$nanother mobile platform provided it carries an equivalent set of$\backslash$nsensors. The 2D case is studied in detail first. Results of extending$\backslash$nthe approach to the 3D case are presented. In both cases the results$\backslash$ndemonstrate the efficacy of the proposed method},

abstract = {The quaternion is generally defined as ¯ q = q 4 + q 1 i + q 2 j + q 3 k (1) where i, j, and k are hyperimaginary numbers satisfying i 2 = −1 , j 2 = −1 , k 2 = −1 , −ij = ji = k , − jk = kj = i , − ki = ik = j (2) Note that this does not correspond to the Hamilton notation. It rather is a convention resulting in multiplications of quaternions in " natural order " (see also section 1.4 and [1, p. 473]). This is in accordance with the JPL Proposed Standard Conventions [2]. The quantity q 4 is the real or scalar part of the quaternion, and q 1 i + q 2 j + q 3 k is the imaginary or vector part. The quaternion can therefore also be written in a four-dimensional column matrix ¯ q, given by ¯ q =},
